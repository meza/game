vampireRaceDescription=Vampires 'life' is all about sucking. They think they rule the night while do \
nothing else just sucking all night long and sleep while the sun is shining. They are the perfect choice for \
'The Nobodies' who thinks they are 'Somebodies'.
dwarfRaceDescription=Dwarves have bad tempers and worse body odour. They rarely came out of their caves, much to \
the relief of all other races. They are the race of choice for people who speak with fake scottish accents at \
renaissance faires and feel uneasy around women.
elfRaceDescription=Elves are slender and beautiful as well as annoying. They live in forests where they molest \
small animals and play boring music all night long. They are the perfect choice for depressed and sociopathic \
players who feel undervalued and misunderstood.
